# First steps with Arduino

After some successful orders of electronic components from China using banggood.com I discovered cheap Arduino clones as well. Inspired by other projects in the web I ordered my first components as well: touchscreen tft display, stepper motor, 2004 display and pressure sensor BMP085 and BMP180. Soon I would make them work!
