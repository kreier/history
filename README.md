# Programming History
Short documentation of programming projects

Over the years I used a handful of programming languages. Here are a few examples for personal documentation.

## 2020

First use of Kotlin with T400 remote project.

## 2019

Started with Jupyter notebook with my students. This includes Markdown, LaTeX, TeX and Python3. Organized with Anaconda.

## 2018

The BeTogetherConference in November 2018 inspired me to write the first lines in Python - and document it in [python2018 repository](https://github.com/kreier/python2018).

## 2008

The Java project [ar65view](https://github.com/kreier/ar65view) was started and uses Swing GUI elements for data analysis at the Humboldt University to Berlin.

## 2000

To solve some problems of my physics study I returned to C and expanded to C++ with some simple coding.

## 1999

Writing my first webpage [saiht.de](http://saiht.de) I started to use HTML.

## 1991

Some TurboPascal at school on 386DX and 486 SX.

## 1990

With my new Atari STFM520 I started Omicron Basic and Lattice C. The latter one was supposed to be fast, developed by a british company, but proved to be inferiour and slower in math calculations than the Basic interpreter. It took another 10 years until I touched C again.

Can't find the files of my Adventure game I programmed back then in Basic. Jan and Dennis tried to solve it, though.

## 1989

Some Basic programming on my [ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81) - gift from my cousin, extended with 16 kByte from an astronomer down the street.

## 1988

The department of education provided us some [KC85/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC_85) in the Haus am Anger and our Math teacher Herr Kl√∂tzer dedicated some time after school for us to learn the first lines of code.
