# Arduino and vacuum

For the purpose of the at the Eichenschule Scheessel we not just wanted to demonstrate the effects of vacuum, we wanted to measure it as well. And we did!

Of course I could have used my [Nexus 4 smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_4) and initially I actually tried. But our cheap diaphragm pump is powerfull enough to lower the pressure below values on the highest mountains, the specifications for the phone and integrated battery reached their limit and so did my willingness to test these limits.

Then January 2016 I had the code compiled and a 2004 display connected to my Arduino. The pressure sensor was a BMP085 from Bosch and [I started my first vacuum measurement](https://youtu.be/KusUbh3XThE). Final pressure: 358 hPa.

[A week later](https://youtu.be/cFKzpqvAh60) we tried with better seal and BMP180 and a "Schaumkuss" in our NaWi-Club. Result: 75 mPa or more than 17 km height (60,000 feet).
